# Privacy Community Group administration repository

This repository is for administration of the
[Privacy Community Group](https://privacycg.github.io/).

This repository's [issue
tracker](https://github.com/privacycg/admin/issues/) is where CG
participants can [raise questions or
concerns](https://github.com/privacycg/admin/issues/new) to the
[chairs](https://privacycg.github.io/charter.html#chairs). It's also
where the chairs [notify the
group](https://github.com/privacycg/admin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aannouncement)
of news.
